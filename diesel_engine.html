            A diesel engine works differently from a petrol engine, even though they share major components and both work on the four-stroke cycle . The main differences are in the way the fuel is ignited and the way the power output is regulated.

In a petrol engine, the fuel/air mixture is ignited by a spark . In a diesel engine, ignition is achieved by compression of air alone. A typical compression ratio for a diesel engine is 20:1, compared with 9:1 for a petrol engine. Compressions as great as this heat up the air to a temperature high enough to ignite the fuel spontaneously, with no need of a spark and therefore of an ignition system.</p>

      <p>A petrol engine draws in variable amounts of air per suction stroke , the exact amount depending on the throttle opening. A diesel engine, on the other hand, always draws in the same amount of air (at each engine speed), through an unthrottled inlet tract that is opened and closed only by the inlet valve (there is neither a carburettor nor a butterfly valve).</p>

<p>When the piston reaches the effective end of its induction stroke, the inlet valve closes. The piston, carried round by the power from the other pistons and the momentum of the flywheel , travels to the top of the cylinder , compressing the air into about a twentieth of its original volume .

As the piston reaches the top of its travel, a precisely metered quantity of diesel fuel is injected into the combustion chamber . The heat from compression fires the fuel/air mixture immediately, causing it to burn and expand. This forces the piston downwards, turning the crankshaft .</p>

<p>As the piston moves up the cylinder on the exhaust stroke , the exhaust valve opens and allows the burned and expanded gases to travel down the exhaust pipe . At the end of the exhaust stroke the cylinder is ready for a fresh charge of air.</p>

            The major components of a diesel engine look like those of a petrol engine and perform the same jobs. However, diesel engine parts have to be made much stronger than their petrol engine equivalents because of the much higher loads involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            The walls of a diesel engine block are normally far thicker than a block designed for a petrol engine, and they have more bracing webs to provide extra strength and to absorb stresses. Apart from being stronger, the heavy-duty block can also reduce noise more effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pistons, connecting rods , crankshafts and bearing caps have to be made stronger than their petrol engine counterparts. The cylinder head design has to be very different because of the fuel injectors and also because of the shape of its combustion and swirl chambers.
